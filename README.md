# Todo List using React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a simple todo list made using these resources, just to practice my skills.
It's quite simple and uses the RAM to store data (that means you lose all your tasks when you reboot the browser). To have a more consistent and long lasting memory, it's necessary to implement a DBMS (Database Management System).

Afterall, this app may be used as a boilerplate for a similar project or as a demo of a todo list app.
